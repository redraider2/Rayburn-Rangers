Well guys, welcome to Sam Rayward. This
0:08
is my home lake. I've been living here
0:09
for about 7 years now. And you know,
0:12
this place has really become like my my
0:14
training ground, my testing ground. This
0:15
is where, you know, we go out and try
0:17
new products and everything else. But I
0:19
have learned so much about tournament
0:21
fishing here on this lake. It's just
0:23
such an awesome place.
0:24
Morning, guys. We're here at Sam Raven.
0:26
We're at home this week and I'm fired up
0:28
about it. It's going to be a great
0:29
tournament. It's going to be a lot of
0:30
fish caught.
0:30
I've had some great events here as well.
0:32
You know, I won a Toyota Series event
0:34
here a couple years ago and I've had a
0:35
lot of really good events. You know,
0:37
that's that's what I just enjoy about
0:38
this place though is it's always a
0:40
challenge. It's always something new and
0:42
uh it really keeps me on my toes even
0:44
when I'm at home preparing me for the
0:46
next year. Sam Raburn's a big one. It's
0:48
114,000
0:50
acres. Sam Rabin sets up like a typical
0:52
East Texas reservoir whenever you look
0:53
at it from an aerial perspective. You
0:55
know, you got three main feeder arms
0:57
into the lake. You got the Angelina arm,
0:59
the Atoyak arm, you got Ash by you. You
1:01
know, the majority of everything kind of
1:03
goes down in that middle section of the
1:06
lake. I would say the upper end of the
1:08
lake play, but only at certain times of
1:10
the year when the conditions are just
1:11
right.
1:12
You know, sometimes we've got hydrillaa,
1:14
sometimes the hay grass is good,
1:16
sometimes buck brushes a deal, sometimes
1:18
the offshore brush pile is a deal. We do
1:20
have a little bit of rock along the
1:22
lower end of the lake, you know, and and
1:24
it does play at times. Uh it's not
1:26
something that typically becomes a
1:27
staple here for the locals. We don't
1:29
usually target the rock on the lower end
1:30
of the lake, but I have seen guys do
1:32
well on it. The clarity of this lake
1:34
really can change drastically depending
1:36
on the amount of rainfall that we're
1:37
getting. I've seen it in years where we
1:39
had good hydrillaa where you could see
1:41
down 8 or 9 ft in some areas. Uh but
1:43
typically we're looking at that 2 to 3t
1:46
of visibility is pretty average here for
1:48
this lake. Predominantly this is a
1:50
largemouth lake. That 5 to 8 lb range is
1:54
a is not an uncommon fish here. And
1:57
that's what's, you know, which makes
1:58
this place so special. How about a
2:00
little raven 814
2:03
for the morning?
2:06
Look at that. You know, we do have
2:08
spotted bass in this lake, but they
2:09
don't tend to get very big. A two
2:11
pounder is a pretty dang big one. And if
2:12
you're breeding in a spotted bass in a
2:14
tournament, you probably didn't have too
2:15
good of a day. Gizzard shad, in my
2:17
opinion, are king here. we have grass
2:18
that, you know, they'll get on that
2:20
crawfish pattern pretty good. I don't
2:22
see that bigger than average quality
2:24
bass targeting the thread pin shad as
2:27
much. I'm always looking for bass that
2:29
are either feeding on gizzard shad,
2:31
bluegill, and and crappie.
2:37
You know, Raven has a a lot of options.
2:40
I would say the town of Brooklyn here is
2:42
a pretty small community, but it's a
2:43
fishing community, couple nice
2:45
restaurants. Most guys typically stay at
2:48
Raburn Country or around Raburn Country.
2:50
There's a really nice restaurant there.
2:52
There's a golf course there. That's a
2:53
good place to stay. And then as you work
2:55
your way up the lake, uh we've got
2:57
Lufkin not far away from that that upper
2:59
end of the Angelina Arm. Uh plenty of
3:01
hotels and stuff to stay there. You
3:03
know, we also have several different
3:05
campgrounds all around the lake that
3:07
have really convenient access to boat
3:08
ramps and have great campsites.
3:14
If you're coming to Sam Raver, the
3:16
number one thing that I can tell you to
3:17
have a successful trip is pay attention
3:18
to the weather. Uh the wind is a huge
3:21
factor here. And so, fortunately, here
3:23
at Sam Raver, we have several different
3:25
access points all around the lake. And
3:27
generally speaking, no matter which
3:29
direction the wind's coming from,
3:30
there's somewhere that you can put in
3:31
and go fishing. Uh but you really need
3:34
to pay attention to that. It will be
3:35
dangerous if the wind's blowing really
3:37
hard. Um so, you just have to take into
3:39
consideration the direction of the wind.
3:41
Look at your map and find you a boat
3:43
ramp that's protected to where you can
3:44
get in and out safely.
3:47
[Music]
Winter
3:57
Well, let's break this thing down, guys.
3:59
We're going to start off in the winter
4:00
time. That's when things really start to
4:01
get kicked up around here. Tournaments
4:03
really start getting kicked up after
4:04
January 1, and you start seeing a ton of
4:06
traffic here at the lake. And and
4:08
honestly, it it's a phenomenal time to
4:10
fish. I feel like it's probably your
4:12
best opportunity to catch that trophy
4:14
size fish here at San Raburn. Uh but
4:16
with the wintertime fishing guys, um
4:18
there there's been winters where, you
4:21
know, I didn't fish much deeper than 8t
4:23
because we had phenomenal hydrol all
4:25
over the place. Here at Raburn for me, I
4:28
mean, I don't catch a ton of them super
4:31
deep here. Uh the majority of the bass
4:33
for me, I'm usually targeting that 8 to
4:36
18 ft range in the winter time. Um, you
4:40
know, wintertime fishing here, I'm
4:43
focusing on this center section of the
4:45
lake here, kind of the lower end, but
4:47
you know, this area here. The problem
4:49
with most of these extremities are is
4:51
that at any given point in time with the
4:53
amount of rainfall that we get here in
4:55
the winter time, this is going to be
4:57
real dirty. So, anytime you get up these
4:59
arms, up the A toyak, further up the
5:02
Angelina, up the ash arm, even here,
5:06
you're you're going to get a lot of
5:07
dirtier water. And it it seems like that
5:09
can be real hit or miss. So, I'm just
5:11
focusing on the center section of the
5:12
lake just to kind of give you guys the
5:14
best opportunity to have a good trip.
5:16
We're going to kind of go over some of
5:17
these main areas that are historically
5:21
been really good in the winter time,
5:24
transitioning into that pre-spawn time.
5:26
Uh, so we've got down here at the
5:29
bottom, this is what we call farmers.
5:32
This is a huge area where these fish can
5:35
winter, roam around, chasing and feeding
5:37
on bait. Just kind of key stuff to look
5:40
for here at Rayurn. And they're going to
5:41
use those drains as highways. And so
5:44
that's that's something you always hear
5:46
about is those drains at Raven. This
5:48
would be an example of a drain right
5:49
here, you know, and it dead ends back
5:51
here. And sometimes I find the fish at
5:54
the back of it. Sometimes I find them at
5:56
a little point in the drain. Sometimes I
5:58
find them at the main point of the
5:59
drain. It just depends. And you have to
6:01
find the fish that day and they're going
6:02
to move around on you. They're not
6:04
always going to sit the same place. It
6:05
just depends on the conditions. But
6:08
we've got farmers here sliding up the
6:10
Angelina arm. You've got Five Fingers.
6:12
This is a huge, you know, community
6:14
area, but this I would say Five Fingers
6:17
has probably has had the best grass out
6:19
of anywhere else in the lake over the
6:21
last 3 or 4 years. It seems like it just
6:23
won't die in there. Like I don't know
6:25
what's going on in Five Fingers, but
6:26
it's always typically got pretty decent
6:28
hydrilla in it, but it also gets a lot
6:30
of pressure. They can be anywhere down
6:32
through there, but when you find the
6:34
right group of them, it really can be a
6:35
special day. And then we've got the
6:37
iconic 147 bridge. Everybody hears about
6:40
the 147 bridge. The 147 down to the dam
6:44
and then probably 3 4 miles above that
6:47
just seems to be where the most
6:49
consistent water is.
6:52
[Music]
6:57
The lake is 7 foot low. So right now you
7:00
can see a lot of what we're going to be
7:01
fishing in the winter time whenever the
7:02
water's up at normal pool. You can see
7:04
the normal bank line up there. And this
7:06
is a great illustration of what's under
7:07
the water here at Sam Raburn. So we've
7:09
got a lot of old standing timber, but
7:11
we've got a lot of brokeoff stumps and
7:13
stuff like this. And and then look in
7:15
between those stumps and you can see
7:17
those little pieces of hard clay and
7:19
rock and gravel. And those are the kind
7:21
of bottom compositions those fish are
7:23
really going to key in on. You want to
7:24
find areas with not just hard cover like
7:26
this, but a good hard bottom like this.
7:30
So, we're talking about wintertime
7:32
fishing. Right now, we're out on Farmer
7:33
Flats. This is just a good example of of
7:37
an area that really has it all within a
7:41
mile of here. There's winter, pre-spawn,
7:45
spawn, postspawn, summertime, and fall.
7:48
like you can do all of that in this
7:50
area. Um we're going to start off with
7:52
wintertime fishing. Those fish are going
7:55
to roam around on these flats during the
7:57
winter time feeding on bait. Um I'm
7:59
going to try to find those fish set up
8:01
on those hard spots on that isolated
8:03
stump, maybe even on that brush pile.
8:06
I'm always going to have a 6XD on my
8:08
deck um from Strike King. The 6XD is an
8:12
allaround great bait for catching big
8:14
fish here at Sam Ra. This bait will go
8:16
anywhere from 8 to 18 ft of water. I'm
8:19
going to blow this thing through those
8:20
schools of fish at a high rate, even in
8:22
the cold of the winter, and try to
8:24
generate those bigger than average
8:25
reaction bites.
8:27
6XD.
8:28
Second thing everyone knows, Carolina
8:31
rig, East Texas, goes hand in hand. It's
8:33
a Carolina rig with a Strike King game
8:36
hog. I'm going to drag this Carolina rig
8:38
around on all these little hard places,
8:40
throwing in isolated stumps, just
8:42
looking for those fish that are just
8:43
kind of hanging out and setting up in
8:45
those wintertime staging areas. Another
8:47
great bait for wintertime fishing all
8:49
around the country, but it's no
8:50
different here in East Texas at Sam
8:52
Raburn. It's a jerkbait. This is a KVD
8:54
200 series from Strike King in this in
8:57
this oyster color. It's just a great
8:58
shad imitation. And I really like this
9:01
this this color for in the winter time
9:03
especially. I'll have a shallow diver
9:05
tied on, but I'll also have a deep diver
9:07
tied on. That deep diving Strike King
9:09
jerk be able to get down to that 12T
9:11
range. And for me, that's a key range in
9:14
the winter time for fishing here at San
9:15
Raver.
9:16
[Music]
Prespawn
9:24
You know, now we're going to transition
9:25
to that pre-spawn stage. You know, I
9:27
feel like that's that stage that we all
9:28
look forward to when it's finally
9:30
starting to warm up. We're tired of
9:31
winter. Feels like the fish are tired of
9:33
winter. The water's warming up. We're
9:35
warming up. Just a great time to be on
9:37
the water. Um, I'm going to start
9:40
sliding more back into these these main
9:43
spawning areas. I'm going to start
9:44
looking for areas where those fish are
9:47
going to stage and and that is going to
9:49
be key throughout this whole deal is
9:51
staging areas. This little area here is
9:52
a classic pre-spawn staging area. So, we
9:55
got a main creek coming off the main
9:56
lake here and we've got it wines on in
10:00
here. And in the winter time, they're
10:01
going to be all these bends and stuff
10:02
out here. As that pre-spawn phase starts
10:05
to happen, you're going to see this bend
10:07
right here, right up next to this point.
10:08
This right here is a classic pre-spawn
10:11
staging area. Same thing back here. This
10:13
creek's going to bend right against the
10:15
bank right here. Another classic
10:17
pre-spawn staging area right there. And
10:19
those fish are going to stage there
10:20
because that bottom is going to be a
10:22
little bit harder with the creek bends
10:23
right there. Anywhere you go in Sam Ray,
10:26
there's there's a million spots like
10:28
that on this lake with it being as big
10:29
as it is, those are the kind of areas
10:31
that you want to look for.
10:32
[Music]
10:39
So, we've slid up a little bit shallower
10:41
here, a little bit further in this
10:43
creek. And as you can see behind me,
10:44
we've got some stumps here, which can be
10:46
great pre-spawn staging areas. Uh, if
10:48
there's hydrillaa here, that's going to
10:50
be great as well. And so, I'm going to
10:52
go over a couple other things. So, for
10:54
one, just keeping in mind, I'm still
10:56
going to have a 6XD out. I'm still going
10:58
to have that Carolina rig out. Um, I'm
11:00
still going to have the jerkbait out,
11:02
especially if those fish, if I find them
11:04
staging on some stumps like that. That's
11:05
a perfect thing to target those fish
11:07
with when they're staging pre-spawn. If
11:09
we've got hydrillaa present, though,
11:11
that's when I'm going to pull out the
11:12
hybrid hunter. We're going to pull out a
11:14
red eyee shad, and we're going to start
11:16
targeting these fish just a little bit
11:17
further back in these creeks, these
11:19
little stopping areas like this stump
11:20
field behind us that are going to
11:22
potentially hold these pre-spawn staging
11:24
big females. I'm here to tell you, this
11:26
one ate a redeye shed, and it was pretty
11:28
dang fun. And he's a pretty dang good
11:30
one. I'm going to keep on fishing and
11:31
keep on having fun.
11:33
[Music]
Spawn
11:40
You know, we're going to transition into
11:42
the spawn, and that is probably
11:44
everyone's favorite time of the year to
11:45
fish. That's whenever you see most
11:47
people out on the lake. I mean, it's
11:49
finally warming up. Those fish are
11:51
moving up. They're up there on those
11:52
shallow flats. They're easier to target
11:54
that way. They're more predictable that
11:56
way. But for the spawn, we're looking
11:58
for these bigger flats with isolated
11:59
cover. It seems like those that's what
12:02
those bigger fish want to target to
12:04
spawn on. What I really like about the
12:05
center section of Ray here is that there
12:08
is a lot of opportunities to bounce
12:10
around. There's so many pockets and
12:12
little creeks and little places where
12:14
they'll spawn that I have a lot of
12:16
options here in the center part of the
12:17
lake. Typically here at Sam Ray, when we
12:20
get a lot of rain in the spring, the
12:21
water starts to rise. it starts getting
12:23
into those bushes and into that flooded
12:25
cover and those fish are going to move
12:27
right on up into that flooded cover and
12:29
spawn there. It's going to give them
12:30
good protection and they're going to
12:31
have everything they need to spawn right
12:33
there. If we're in a year with good
12:35
hydrillaa and good grass, I'll start
12:36
looking for these flats like this that
12:38
run way out off the bank. Uh this
12:40
potentially is going to have isolated
12:41
stumps on it. It's going to have
12:42
hydrillaa on it and those fish will
12:44
spawn way out there off the bank with no
12:46
problem whatsoever. You know, we've got
12:48
these little pockets that run back in
12:49
here. You know, I really like this bank
12:52
right here because you got a channel
12:53
swing right here on the edge of it.
12:54
Those fish could really just slide right
12:56
on up here, spawn, slide right back out.
12:58
You know, this is going to be a great
13:00
area, but it really just depends on the
13:02
current conditions, whether or not we
13:03
have hydrillaa that year or whether or
13:05
not the water's high and flooded up in
13:06
the cover. The fish are going to use
13:08
whatever cover they have available to
13:10
them to spawn on. That's for sure.
13:12
Whether that's an isolated stump out
13:13
here on this flat, whether it's hydrilla
13:15
on this flat, or whether or not it's
13:16
buck brush all up here on the bank. And
13:18
that's just key with Sam Raurn. Like I
13:20
said so many times, I can't reiterate
13:22
the fact enough that, you know, it just
13:24
depends on the current year and the
13:26
current conditions. If the water's high,
13:27
those fish are going to flood up into
13:29
that flooded buck brush. If there's good
13:31
hydrilla, those fish are going to really
13:32
like to be on those flats. It just
13:34
depends on the particular year.
13:38
[Music]
13:42
Moving on into the spawn of the year.
13:44
Everyone's favorite time of the year to
13:45
be fishing, man. You know, if you look
13:47
behind me, you can see, like I said, the
13:49
lake is 7 foot low right now, but you
13:51
can see where that water is typically
13:52
at. We've got some cypress trees here.
13:55
Got tons of buck brush. We've got hay
13:57
grass up there on the bank. When that
13:59
water comes back up in the springtime,
14:01
that's where a lot of these fish are
14:02
going to go. And there's a lot of
14:03
different ways to target them. But, you
14:05
know, I'm going to go go over a couple
14:06
key ways that I like to do it. But, you
14:08
know, a staple obviously here at Raum
14:10
when the water's up and in the bushes is
14:12
flipping. I've got a rage crawl here on
14:14
a on a 1 ounce weight. It just depends
14:17
on how much water's in those bushes
14:18
depending on what size weight I use.
14:20
Sometimes I'm going to be flipping a
14:21
quarter, sometimes it's going to be a
14:22
three/ quarter. It just depends on the
14:24
situation. Um, throwing a popping perch
14:27
is also going to be a great way to get
14:28
some big bites. I love skipping this
14:31
popping perch around these bushes. Uh,
14:33
it's a great way to catch some big ones.
14:35
That hay grass is going to hold a ton of
14:37
heat as the water starts to warm up. a
14:40
sunny day like today, you're trying to
14:41
cover water just a ice just to kind of
14:43
get an idea of a good stretch. You know,
14:45
a swim jig's hard to beat, especially
14:47
around this hay grass. Covering a bunch
14:49
of water is a great way to do that with
14:50
a swim jig.
Postspawn
14:59
So, as the post spawn starts to happen,
15:01
you got to think about what's going on.
15:02
Those fish are kind of starting to move
15:04
back out, I feel like, into those main
15:05
lake areas in some cases. Um, but also
15:09
you got to think about the bluegill that
15:10
are going to be moving into those areas
15:12
as well. So that that presents a unique
15:14
opportunity for those fish to feed back
15:16
up right after the spawn on bluegill as
15:19
the bluegill are starting to spawn.
15:20
You've also got the shad spawn starting
15:22
to happen. And so fish are really kind
15:25
of moving all over the place at this
15:26
point in time. So I'll show you a couple
15:28
areas that I want to look for for that
15:30
post spawn areas where the shad are
15:32
going to be starting to spawn and also
15:33
bluegill are going to be starting to
15:34
spawn. So we'll start in the back of
15:36
this creek here. You know, this is a
15:38
creek we've been looking at, but it's
15:39
just a good example. So, we've got a we
15:41
got some flooded timber back in here.
15:42
Those fish could definitely stage on
15:44
that. I haven't really mentioned that
15:45
yet, but you could definitely see some
15:47
postspawn fish hanging around this
15:48
flooded timber back in here. We've got a
15:50
big flat here where those bass were
15:51
spawning. There's going to be some late
15:53
spawners still hanging out there. We're
15:55
going to have bluegills starting to move
15:56
make their way into these flats and
15:58
start to spawn themselves. So, that's
15:59
going to hold some bigger fish. And then
16:01
also, you know, we've got these points
16:03
here, a point here, point here, point
16:05
here. you know, the shad are going to
16:06
really start moving in these areas and
16:08
spawning themselves. So, that's going to
16:10
be huge for these fish to move out to
16:12
these little spawning areas for the shad
16:14
and really start to feed up as they
16:16
start to recover from the bass spawn.
16:24
So, we've slid back out a little bit
16:26
further to go over that post spawn
16:27
phase. You know, as these fish start to
16:29
make their way back out of these main
16:31
spawning pockets and creeks, you know,
16:33
I'm going to really start to look to
16:34
target them early in the morning on a
16:36
shad spawn. And behind me, I have a
16:38
perfect representation of a good shad
16:39
spawn point. It's got some stumps on it.
16:41
Obviously, you can see that with the
16:42
water low and it's got a good hay grass
16:44
line up there on the bank where it's
16:46
which is going to typically be the bank
16:48
at that time of year. Those shad are
16:50
going to really spawn in that hay grass.
16:52
And there is no better way to catch them
16:54
than with a popping perch and a swim
16:56
jig. We've already talked about these
16:57
two baits, but these are two great ways
16:59
to catch those fish around that hay
17:00
grass when the shatter spawning. We're
17:03
also going to have the bluegill spawn
17:04
kind of starting and that's going to
17:05
transition through those early summer
17:07
months. I'm going to target those fish
17:08
with a swim jig and a popping perch as
17:10
well. The only difference is is that
17:12
with this popping perch, I've got a shad
17:14
pattern here. I'm going to probably go
17:16
to more of a bluegill pattern when I'm
17:18
throwing it around those bushes trying
17:19
to catch those big brim meters. Uh same
17:21
thing with swim jig. We'll go to a brim
17:23
pattern on it and then we'll still have
17:25
a flipping stick out pitching and
17:26
flipping around those bushes as well.
17:28
That rage craw is good for that.
17:30
[Music]
Summer
17:38
We're moving on into summer. It's
17:40
getting hot and this gets to be kind of
17:41
the grind time, right? As we get in that
17:43
summer and fall time, it can be really
17:45
tough. It could be really hard
17:46
physically and mentally because it gets
17:48
so hot here. Um, but the fishing can be
17:51
hot, too, right? For me, I really like
17:54
to target brush piles this time of year.
17:56
Uh, and we have an unlimited amount of
17:58
brush piles in this lake. I mean, it's
17:59
ridiculous how much brush is in here. I
18:01
want to look for those brush piles that
18:03
are staging a bunch of bluegill. Um, and
18:05
I want to also look for those brush
18:07
piles that have a lot of crappie in
18:08
them. That bigger forge, like the
18:10
bluegill and like the crappie, that's
18:12
the bigger forage that I'm looking for
18:14
those bigger bass to be feeding on in
18:15
the summertime. and they can get one or
18:16
two good meals a day and they're set.
18:19
I'm going to look for those fish in
18:21
brush piles mostly around main lake
18:24
stuff. Got this big main lake ridge that
18:27
runs out here that's probably going to
18:28
have brush littered all on it. You know,
18:30
the locals put out a ton of brush here.
18:32
So, just finding the right brush and the
18:34
right depth range is typically key. You
18:36
know, and that depth range can go from
18:38
anywhere from 8 ft all the way out to
18:40
probably 25 30 ft. Uh so a lot of times
18:43
the the the locals will build these
18:45
brush piles here at Sam Raburn for
18:46
crappie. They might put a 20 foot tall
18:49
tree out here in 30 foot of water and
18:51
it's going to come up to 10t, you know,
18:54
um from the surface. And so if I'm
18:56
finding those better than average, those
18:58
big females are wanting to sit in that
19:00
10t range and I'mma find brush piles
19:03
that come up to that 10t on the surface
19:05
range and that that's a comfort zone
19:08
that they want to be in. That's what I'm
19:09
going to kind of look for. But for me,
19:11
summertime and brush fishing go hand in
19:14
hand.
19:15
[Music]
19:21
You know, the summertime is probably the
19:23
best time just to get bites. I mean, the
19:25
fish are active, it's warm, and it's
19:27
probably, like I said, the easiest time
19:29
of the year to get bit, but the reality
19:31
is I like to target the bigger ones. Uh,
19:33
usually I'm fishing tournaments, even if
19:34
it's a Tuesday night evening jackpot
19:36
here. And so, I'm looking for that
19:38
bigger than average bite. And so I'm
19:40
usually throwing big baits. Um, this is
19:42
a Hogfather Jr. from Strike King. This
19:44
is a great bait to target these fish in
19:45
these offshore brush piles. Uh, I like
19:47
throwing a big Strike King bull worm.
19:50
Um, that thumper worm from Strike King
19:52
is another great one. That Rage Cutter
19:53
worm, it's another big worm from Strike
19:55
King that's really good usually in a a
19:58
red bug or some kind of red color, maybe
20:00
a green pumpkin. Those are my go-to
20:02
colors for the summertime here at Sam
20:04
Raburn. Uh, for sure. And then throwing
20:06
this Hogfather Jr. They're just
20:08
imitating like a big gizzard shed or
20:10
maybe a big brim, maybe even a big uh
20:12
crappie, you know, coming over lazily
20:14
across top of one of these brush piles.
20:15
Uh you're not going to get a lot of
20:17
bites in this bait. Uh but the right
20:20
ones will eat it.
Fall
20:25
[Music]
20:28
You know, traditionally, you know, fall
20:31
fishing is probably the toughest time of
20:34
the year to fish really anywhere,
20:36
honestly. Um, but it can also be some of
20:39
the best days. Uh, if you want to learn
20:41
how to use live scope, that's the time
20:42
of the year to really like capitalize on
20:45
it because a lot of the fish tend to
20:47
suspend.
20:51
Yes, sir. Oh gosh, this bag is kicking
20:54
my butt, my man. I lost the mic, but we
20:59
got to pass.
21:00
Uh, the lake start to turn over. the
21:02
oxygen levels really depleted after a
21:04
long hot summer, especially with no
21:06
current and not a lot of wind current.
21:08
That oxygen level really starts to rise.
21:10
So, that pushes the bait up. It pushes
21:12
the fish up and those fish really want
21:13
to stay closer to the surface. And it
21:15
can be really tricky to get them to bite
21:16
cuz they're probably not in the best
21:17
mood with extremely hot water and low
21:20
oxygen content. But, you can find those
21:22
fish in predictable places and you can
21:24
get a couple really big bites and have
21:25
the entire lake to yourself. Uh, I'm
21:27
going to look for those fish still on
21:29
those main lake areas. You know, a lot
21:31
of those fish are going to be pushed up
21:32
on that surface. The bait's going to be
21:33
on the surface, but really, you know,
21:35
they just kind of float around with the
21:36
wind and quite literally, I mean, you
21:38
know, at times they're going to be way
21:40
back in these pockets and in these
21:41
creeks and then they might be back on
21:43
the main lake the next day. So, really,
21:45
I'm going to be looking for those birds
21:46
that are maybe feeding on them from the
21:48
surface. I'm going to be just looking
21:50
for that bait on my on my Garmin units,
21:52
looking for my side imaging, my down
21:54
imaging, and then finding the fish
21:55
around the bait, you know, and and like
21:57
I said, establishing where that
21:58
thermocline's at, what depth range the
22:01
fish want to be in, and then looking for
22:02
areas to target them in in that depth
22:04
range. Uh that could be anywhere from
22:06
main lake stuff, secondary points, even
22:08
in the backs of these creeks here. It
22:10
just depends on a particular day and the
22:12
current conditions.
22:18
[Music]
22:20
All right, so it's fall now. It's grind
22:21
time, right? This is that late time of
22:23
the year where there's not a lot of
22:24
boats in the water, but it can be a
22:26
great way to have the entire lake to
22:27
yourself if you unlock the pattern and
22:28
have some really good days on the water.
22:30
Throwing a sexy dog, especially early in
22:32
the morning on points, catching those
22:33
fish schooling is a great way to catch
22:35
them when they're up on top. And when
22:36
they're not visibly up on top and you
22:38
can't see them, they're very hard to
22:39
target when they're just out roaming in
22:41
open water. And so, um, using your live
22:44
scope, running around, like looking at
22:46
drains, finding bait, and then finding
22:47
those fish that are chasing that bait,
22:49
setting up over open water is a really
22:51
fun way to catch a lot of fish. And you
22:53
can catch some really big ones doing
22:54
that. I'm going to keep it pretty
22:55
simple. I'm throwing a Z2 on a little
22:57
light jig head, keeping that bait up
22:59
high in the water column and targeting
23:01
those fish around bait.
23:04
Ball of bait. And there's some fish in
23:06
them, too. I just Oh, there we go. There
23:09
we go. come right out of that bowl date
23:12
bait.
23:14
That is a textbook scenario. This is not
23:16
a textbook sander bass, not size-wise
23:20
anyways, but that is fall fishing in a
23:22
sense. I mean, and it can be a lot of
23:23
fun. You can catch a lot of them. And uh
23:25
it's a great way to get familiar with
23:26
your electronics. I mean, because that
23:28
most of the fish, I'm saying 90% of the
23:31
bass in the lake, and this goes for
23:33
lakes all across the country in the
23:34
fall, are usually roaming around on bait
23:37
at that time of the year. And it can be
23:38
very hard to catch them if you can't see
23:40
them.

[Music]
23:51
Thank you guys for watching. Man, uh
23:53
this has been such a phenomenal lake for
23:55
me over the years. Has taught me so much
23:57
about bass fishing. I've had some great
23:58
memories with family and friends here at
24:00
this Umbry pavilion at huge tournaments.
24:03
Uh, you know, if you're looking for a
24:04
place to come, whether you're, you know,
24:06
it's a tournament destination or even if
24:07
you're out coming fun fishing with your
24:09
family and friends, this is a great
24:11
place to come and look forward to seeing
24:12
you around.
24:15
Right here.
24:15
Oh my god.
